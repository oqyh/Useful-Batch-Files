![Delete All Specific What In txt](https://github.com/oqyh/Useful-Batch-Files/assets/48490385/ca8dc5bd-5596-492f-a1b0-4e4a8687d3fe)


## What Does That Mean?
start.bat Will delete what's in delete-these-files.txt only
and make sure you include extension at end of file names (file.txt .. file.exe ... file.png)


## Example?


### Folder Contains
 - a.txt
 - b.txt
 - c.txt

### Added in delete-these-files.txt
 - a.txt
 - b.txt

### Pressing start.bat

### Result will be 
 - c.txt
